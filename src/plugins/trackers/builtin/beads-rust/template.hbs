  ABOUTME: Beads-rust tracker prompt template.
  Context-first structure: PRD -> Task -> Workflow (br CLI)

  This template is specific to the beads-rust tracker (br), so its workflow
  instructions can diverge from the default beads (bd) template.

{{!-- Full PRD for project context (agent studies this first) --}}
{{#if prdContent}}
We are working in a project to implement the following Product Requirements Document (PRD):

{{prdContent}}

{{/if}}

## Bead Details
- **ID**: {{taskId}}
- **Title**: {{taskTitle}}
{{#if epicId}}
- **Epic**: {{epicId}}{{#if epicTitle}} - {{epicTitle}}{{/if}}
{{/if}}
{{#if taskDescription}}
- **Description**: {{taskDescription}}
{{/if}}

{{#if acceptanceCriteria}}
## Acceptance Criteria
{{acceptanceCriteria}}
{{/if}}

{{#if dependsOn}}
**Prerequisites**: {{dependsOn}}
{{/if}}

{{#if recentProgress}}
## Recent Progress
{{recentProgress}}
{{/if}}

## Workflow
1. Study the PRD context above to understand the bigger picture (if available)
2. Study `.ralph-tui/progress.md` to understand overall status, implementation progress, and learnings including codebase patterns and gotchas
3. Implement the requirements (stay on current branch)
4. Run your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, etc.)
{{#if config.autoCommit}}
5. Do NOT create git commits. Changes will be committed automatically by the engine after task completion.
{{else}}
5. Do NOT create git commits. Leave all changes uncommitted for manual review.
{{/if}}
6. Close the bead: `br close {{taskId}} --reason "Brief description"`
7. Flush tracker state to JSONL (no git side effects): `br sync --flush-only`
8. Document learnings (see below)
9. Signal completion

## Before Completing
APPEND to `.ralph-tui/progress.md`:
```
## [Date] - {{taskId}}
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
---
```

If you discovered a **reusable pattern**, also add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.md.

## Stop Condition
**IMPORTANT**: If the work is already complete (implemented in a previous iteration or already exists), verify it works correctly and signal completion immediately.

When finished (or if already complete), signal completion with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
