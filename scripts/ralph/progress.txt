## Codebase Patterns
- Use `pnpm typecheck` before committing
- ESLint 9 uses flat config format (eslint.config.js)
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled - all code must be fully typed
- OpenTUI requires Zig and Bun for native terminal rendering
- Use `bun run ./src/cli.tsx` to run the TUI in development
- Directory structure: src/{commands,tui,plugins/{agents,trackers}}
- TUI components go in src/tui/components/
- Package is ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- ABOUTME comment pattern required at top of each source file
- Use ReactNode return type instead of JSX.Element for component return types
- OpenTUI uses bundler module resolution - use `moduleResolution: "bundler"` in tsconfig
- Tracker plugins go in src/plugins/trackers/ with types, registry, base class
- Agent plugins go in src/plugins/agents/ with types, registry, base class
- Plugin architecture uses factory pattern + singleton registry
- CLI subcommands handled in src/cli.tsx with handleSubcommand()
- Agent plugins support detect(), execute(), interrupt() for AI CLI lifecycle
- BaseAgentPlugin spawns child processes with streaming output callbacks
- Configuration stored in YAML at ~/.config/ralph-tui/config.yaml
- Session/lock files stored in .ralph-session/ relative to cwd
- Iteration output saved to .ralph-output/ directory
- Use yaml package for YAML parsing
- Event-driven architecture for engine-to-TUI communication
- Commands that use JSX must have .tsx extension (not .ts)

  - src/cli.tsx (updated) - Handle 'plugins agents' subcommand
- **Learnings:**
  - Agent plugins are fundamentally different from tracker plugins - they execute work (spawn CLIs) vs manage state
  - The detect() method checks CLI availability (runs --version), returns path and version info
  - AgentExecutionHandle provides promise + interrupt() + isRunning() for controlling executions
  - Child process management with timeout and SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation for clean shutdown
  - Streaming callbacks (onStdout, onStderr) enable real-time output in TUI
---

  - `ralph-tui run` command with comprehensive CLI argument parsing
  - Configuration system (src/config/) with YAML loading from ~/.config/ralph-tui/config.yaml
  - Session and lock management (src/session/) for preventing concurrent instances
  - Execution engine (src/engine/) with iteration loop: select task → build prompt → run agent → check result
  - RunApp TUI component that integrates with the execution engine via events
  - Support for --epic, --prd, --agent, --model, --tracker, --iterations, --resume, --force, --headless flags
  - <promise>COMPLETE</promise> detection in agent output to signal task completion

  - src/tui/components/index.ts (updated) - Export RunApp
  - package.json (updated) - Added yaml dependency
  - bun.lock (new) - Lockfile migrated from pnpm
- **Learnings:**
  - JSX files need .tsx extension for TypeScript to recognize JSX syntax

  - The yaml package provides YAML parsing for config files
  - Session persistence enables resume capability across process restarts
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.9
- What was implemented:
  - Full BeadsTrackerPlugin implementing TrackerPlugin interface
  - detect(): Check for .beads/ directory and bd binary availability
  - getTasks(): Execute bd list --json with parent/status/labels filters
  - getTask(): Execute bd show ID --json for single task detail with dependencies
  - completeTask(): Execute bd update ID --status=closed with reason
  - updateTaskStatus(): Update task status via bd update command
  - sync(): Bidirectional sync with bd sync command
  - isComplete(): Check if all epic children are closed
  - Setup questions: epicId (required), beadsDir, labels
  - Status mapping between bd (closed/open) and TrackerTask (completed/open)
  - BeadJson interface matching bd JSON output structure
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/trackers/builtin/beads.ts (updated from stub to full implementation)
- **Learnings:**
  - CLI wrapper pattern is preferable to direct file parsing - lets bd handle format evolution
  - bd dependencies array includes both "blocks" (true deps) and "parent-child" relationships
  - Two-tier filtering: push simple filters (status, labels) to CLI, complex filters (ready) in memory
  - bd --json output is consistent between list and show commands
  - bd update uses --status flag not --close_reason for closing beads
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.22
- What was implemented:
  - Error handling strategies: retry, skip, abort (configurable via ErrorHandlingConfig)
  - ErrorHandlingStrategy and ErrorHandlingConfig types in engine/types.ts
  - CLI options --on-error and --max-retries in RuntimeOptions
  - DEFAULT_ERROR_HANDLING constant with sensible defaults (skip, 3 retries, 5s delay)
  - New engine events: iteration:retrying, iteration:skipped
  - Enhanced iteration:failed event with 'action' field indicating retry/skip/abort
  - isTaskReady(id) method added to TrackerPlugin interface
  - Retry logic with configurable maxRetries and retryDelayMs
  - Skip logic that tracks skipped tasks to avoid re-selection
  - Abort logic that stops engine immediately on failure
- Files changed:
  - src/engine/types.ts (updated) - Added ErrorHandlingStrategy, ErrorHandlingConfig, new event types
  - src/engine/index.ts (updated) - Added runIterationWithErrorHandling, getNextAvailableTask, retry/skip tracking
  - src/config/types.ts (updated) - Added onError, maxRetries to RuntimeOptions, errorHandling to RalphConfig
  - src/config/index.ts (updated) - Build errorHandling config with CLI overrides
  - src/plugins/trackers/types.ts (updated) - Added isTaskReady(id) method to interface
  - src/plugins/trackers/base.ts (updated) - Implemented isTaskReady(id), renamed helper to checkTaskReady
- **Learnings:**
  - Error handling strategies should be pluggable with sensible defaults (skip is safest for autonomous agents)
  - Retry logic needs state tracking (retryCountMap) to persist across recursive calls
  - Skipped tasks need a Set to prevent re-selection in the same session
  - When max retries exceeded, fallback to skip is more graceful than abort for autonomous loops
  - Event-driven design allows TUI to display all error handling states without tight coupling

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.8
- What was implemented:
  - Full JsonTrackerPlugin for prd.json file-based task tracking
  - PrdJson and PrdUserStory interfaces matching the prd.json format spec
  - File I/O with caching (1 second TTL) for read performance
  - getTasks(): Read user stories with passes field mapped to status
  - getNextTask(): Select highest priority open task with no unresolved dependencies
  - completeTask(): Update passes: true in file with optional reason/notes
  - updateTaskStatus(): Update passes field based on TrackerTaskStatus
  - isComplete(): Check all stories have passes: true
  - Setup questions: path to prd.json file, git branch name
  - Validation: file exists, valid JSON, has userStories array
  - Priority mapping: prd 1-based to TrackerTask 0-4 scale
  - Dependency support via dependsOn field for story-to-story deps
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/trackers/builtin/json.ts (updated from stub to full implementation)
- **Learnings:**
  - File-based trackers are simpler than CLI wrappers but require careful caching
  - The passes boolean field maps directly to completed/open status (no in_progress)
  - Caching with TTL prevents excessive file reads during rapid getTasks() calls
  - JSON pretty-printing (2-space indent) maintains human readability of prd.json
  - The prd.json format is intentionally simpler than beads - no sync, no CLI deps
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.12
- What was implemented:
  - US-012: Task List View with full acceptance criteria
  - Updated status indicators to match spec: ✓ (done), ▶ (active), ○ (pending), ⊘ (blocked)
  - Task ID displayed in muted color alongside truncated task title
  - Added truncateText() helper for graceful text truncation with ellipsis
  - Footer updated to show "X/Y complete" format instead of just "X/Y"
  - Enter key handling in App and RunApp to drill into task details
  - Added onTaskDrillDown callback prop for parent components to handle navigation
- Files changed:
  - src/tui/theme.ts (updated) - Changed status indicators for active (▶) and blocked (⊘)
  - src/tui/types.ts (updated) - Added onTaskDrillDown callback to LeftPanelProps
  - src/tui/components/LeftPanel.tsx (updated) - Task ID display, truncation support, maxWidth prop
  - src/tui/components/Footer.tsx (updated) - "complete" suffix in task counter
  - src/tui/components/App.tsx (updated) - Enter key handling, onTaskDrillDown prop
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Enter key handling, onTaskDrillDown prop
- **Learnings:**
  - OpenTUI keyboard events use 'return' not 'enter' for the Enter key (but we handle both for safety)
  - Task truncation needs to account for status indicator + ID + spaces when calculating available width
  - The callback pattern (onTaskDrillDown) keeps components decoupled - LeftPanel doesn't need to know what happens on drill-down
  - Having both 'return' and 'enter' cases handles different terminal emulator behaviors
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.14
- What was implemented:
  - US-014: Iteration History View with full acceptance criteria
  - IterationHistoryView component displaying all iterations with key events
  - Status indicators: ✓ (completed), ▶ (running), ○ (pending), ✗ (failed), ⊘ (interrupted), ⊖ (skipped)
  - Each row shows: iteration number ("Iteration 1 of 10"), task ID, duration, outcome
  - Integrated with RunApp via 'i' key toggle between Tasks and Iterations views
  - Keyboard navigation (up/down/j/k) through iterations list
  - Enter key drills into iteration details via onIterationDrillDown callback

  - src/tui/types.ts (updated) - Added IterationHistoryPanelProps, IterationResult import
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - View mode toggle, iteration state, navigation
- **Learnings:**
  - Extended IterationStatus type with DisplayIterationStatus to handle 'pending' for UI purposes
  - Discriminated unions (type: 'result' | 'pending') enable type-safe rendering of mixed lists
  - Separate selectedIndex states (tasks vs iterations) prevent confusion when switching views
  - View mode toggle pattern keeps TUI responsive without needing separate screens
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.19
- What was implemented:
  - US-019: Session Persistence with full acceptance criteria
  - PersistedSessionState type for saving: iteration, task statuses, start time, pause state, tracker state
  - Session file saved to .ralph-tui-session.json in project root
  - Session state saved automatically after each iteration completes
  - `ralph-tui resume` command to continue from saved state
  - `ralph-tui status` command to check if resumable session exists
  - Prompt shown when existing session found on `ralph-tui run`
  - Session file cleaned up automatically on successful completion
- Files changed:
  - src/session/persistence.ts (new) - Session persistence types and functions
  - src/session/index.ts (updated) - Export persistence module

  - src/commands/index.ts (updated) - Export new commands
  - src/cli.tsx (updated) - Handle resume and status subcommands
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - Integrate session persistence
- **Learnings:**
  - Session persistence uses a separate file (.ralph-tui-session.json) from the lock system (.ralph-session/)
  - State updates use immutable patterns with spread operators for safe concurrent access
  - Event-driven iteration completion hooks allow persistence without tight coupling
  - Session cleanup on completion prevents stale data; interrupted sessions remain resumable
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.2
- What was implemented:
  - US-002: Configuration System with Zod validation
  - Zod schema (src/config/schema.ts) for runtime config validation with helpful error messages
  - Project-level config support (.ralph-tui.yaml) that overrides global (~/.config/ralph-tui/config.yaml)
  - Config file search walks up directory tree from cwd to find project config
  - Deep merge strategy: project overrides global for scalars, replaces arrays entirely
  - `ralph-tui config show` command to display merged configuration with source info
  - `ralph-tui config help` with example config and documentation
  - Shorthand fields: agent, tracker, agentOptions, trackerOptions, autoCommit

  - src/config/types.ts (updated) - Added new StoredConfig fields
  - src/config/index.ts (updated) - Multi-file loading, merge logic, validation integration
  - src/commands/config.ts (new) - Config show and help commands
  - src/commands/index.ts (updated) - Export config commands
  - src/cli.tsx (updated) - Handle config subcommand
- **Learnings:**
  - Zod provides type inference from schemas, making the schema the single source of truth
  - Layered config (global → project → CLI) is a common pattern for dev tools
  - Array replacement vs merge: replacing gives projects full control over plugin lists
  - File search upward from cwd is standard for project config (like .gitignore, .eslintrc)
---

- What was implemented:
  - US-003: Interactive Project Setup wizard
  - Detect when no .ralph-tui.yaml exists in current directory
  - Prompt for issue tracker selection from installed tracker plugins
  - Show tracker-specific follow-up questions via getSetupQuestions()
  - Auto-detect installed agent CLIs (checks binary availability)
  - Prompt for max iterations per run (default: 10)
  - Prompt for auto-commit on task completion (yes/no)
  - Save configuration to .ralph-tui.yaml with YAML serialization
  - Add --no-setup flag to skip interactive wizard
  - Styled terminal prompts with ANSI colors
- Files changed:
  - src/setup/types.ts (new) - Type definitions for wizard state, answers, plugin detection

- **Learnings:**
  - Node.js readline works well for cross-platform terminal input
  - Plugin registries provide getSetupQuestions() for tracker-specific config
  - The factory pattern + singleton registry decouple plugin creation from discovery
  - Ctrl+C handling requires catching readline close errors gracefully
  - TypeScript union types need explicit handling in switch exhaustiveness checks
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.10
- What was implemented:
  - Full BeadsBvTrackerPlugin extending BeadsTrackerPlugin for smart task selection
  - detect(): Check for .beads/ directory, bd binary, and bv binary availability
  - getNextTask(): Execute bv --robot-triage, filter for epic children, return highest scored task
  - Parse JSON output for recommendations with scores, reasons, and breakdown metrics
  - getTaskReasoning(): Expose bv's "why this task" reasoning to TUI
  - getAllTaskReasoning(): Get all cached task reasoning from last triage

  - Graceful fallback to beads-only behavior when bv unavailable
  - Recipe support: --recipe actionable (no blockers) or high-impact (PageRank)
  - Automatic triage refresh after completeTask() and updateTaskStatus()
  - Score breakdown parsing: pagerank, betweenness, staleness, urgency, risk, etc.

  - isBvAvailable(): Check if smart mode is active
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/trackers/builtin/beads-bv.ts (updated from stub to full implementation)
- **Learnings:**
  - TypeScript private fields prevent subclass access - use protected or config object pattern
  - bv --robot-triage provides comprehensive scoring in one call vs --robot-next for just top pick
  - Caching triage output enables efficient getTaskReasoning() lookups without re-querying bv
  - Graceful fallback pattern: check bvAvailable flag, call super.getNextTask() on any failure
  - Async triage refresh with `void this.refreshTriage()` keeps CRUD operations fast
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.6
- What was implemented:
  - Full ClaudeAgentPlugin implementing AgentPlugin interface
  - detect(): Uses `which` to find claude binary, then runs --version to verify
  - buildArgs(): Constructs CLI args with --print, --output-format, --model, --dangerously-skip-permissions
  - File context support via --add-dir flag for directories containing specified files
  - Setup questions for printMode (text/json/stream), model (sonnet/opus/haiku), skipPermissions (boolean)
  - Configurable timeout inherited from BaseAgentPlugin (defaults to 0 = no timeout)
  - Validation for printMode and model config values
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/agents/builtin/claude.ts (updated from stub to full implementation)
- **Learnings:**
  - Claude Code CLI uses --print for non-interactive mode (not -p shorthand in code, but --print)
  - The --dangerously-skip-permissions flag enables autonomous operation without user confirmation
  - Using `which` for binary detection is more reliable than just trying to execute --version
  - File context via --add-dir adds directories to Claude's working context, not individual files
  - The base class already handles SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation for timeout - just set defaultTimeout
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.7
- What was implemented:
  - Full OpenCodeAgentPlugin implementing AgentPlugin interface
  - detect(): Uses `which` to find opencode binary, then runs --version to verify

  - Model support via --model flag with provider/model format (e.g., anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet)
  - File context support via --file flag (can be used multiple times)
  - Agent type selection via --agent flag (general, build, plan)
  - Output format selection via --format flag (default, json)
  - Setup questions for provider, model, agent type, and output format
  - Configurable timeout inherited from BaseAgentPlugin (defaults to 0 = no timeout)
  - Validation for provider, agent, and format config values
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/agents/builtin/opencode.ts (updated from stub to full implementation)

  - OpenCode uses `opencode run <prompt>` for non-interactive mode (not flags like --print)
  - Model format is provider/model (e.g., anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet, openai/gpt-4o)
  - OpenCode supports multiple agent types: general (default), build, plan - switchable via --agent
  - The --file flag can be used multiple times to attach multiple files
  - Providers include: anthropic, openai, google, xai, ollama

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.13
- What was implemented:
  - US-013: Task Detail View with full acceptance criteria
  - TaskDetailView component with comprehensive task details display
  - Full task title, ID, status, and metadata section
  - Description in scrollable container (separated from acceptance criteria)

  - Priority display with color coding (P0-P4, mapped to error/warning/normal colors)
  - Labels/tags display with accent color styling
  - Dependencies section showing "Blocked by" and "Blocks" relationships
  - Completion notes section for closed tasks
  - Extended TaskItem type with additional fields (priority, labels, dependsOn, blocks, closeReason, etc.)
  - View mode toggle in App and RunApp (list <-> detail)
  - Esc key handling to return from detail view to list view
  - 't' key shortcut to return to task list from any view

  - src/tui/components/index.ts (updated) - Export TaskDetailView
  - src/tui/types.ts (updated) - Extended TaskItem type, added TaskDetailViewProps
- **Learnings:**
  - OpenTUI's TextProps doesn't support 'bold' attribute - text styling is done via colors/fg only
  - The TaskPriority type should be imported from trackers/types.ts to avoid duplicate exports
  - Acceptance criteria parsing can be done by looking for markdown checklist patterns
  - View mode toggle pattern with detailTask state allows full-screen detail views
  - Separating q (quit) and Escape (back) provides better UX for drill-down navigation
---

  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - View mode toggle and keyboard handling
  - src/tui/components/index.ts (updated) - Export IterationDetailView
- **Learnings:**
  - Code block syntax highlighting can be done by detecting ``` markers and rendering in different styles
  - Timeline events are built from IterationResult data - start/agent/task completion/end events
  - The iteration-detail view follows the same pattern as task-detail: full-screen scrollbox with Esc to return
  - OpenTUI scrollbox handles large content well for potentially large agent outputs
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.16
- What was implemented:
  - US-016: Progress Dashboard with full acceptance criteria
  - ProgressDashboard component showing comprehensive execution status
  - Task progress bar: completed / total tasks with percentage

  - src/tui/components/index.ts (updated) - Export ProgressDashboard
  - src/tui/theme.ts (updated) - Added 'd' shortcut for dashboard toggle
- **Learnings:**
  - ETA calculation needs at least one completed iteration before providing an estimate
  - The dashboard toggle pattern keeps the TUI uncluttered while providing detail on demand
  - Tracking completedIterations separately from iterations array allows for accurate ETA math
  - Nested ProgressBar components keep the main component clean and reusable

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.17
- What was implemented:
  - US-017: Pause and Resume with full acceptance criteria
  - Added 'pausing' status to EngineStatus type to distinguish "pause requested" from "actually paused"
  - Engine runLoop now properly waits when paused instead of continuing immediately
  - Press 'p' to request pause - shows "Pausing after current iteration..." status
  - Engine transitions to 'paused' state after current iteration completes
  - Press 'p' again while pausing to cancel the pause request
  - Press 'p' while paused to resume execution
  - Paused state is persisted to .ralph-tui-session.json via pauseSession() function
  - Sessions with 'paused' status are resumable with `ralph-tui resume`
  - User can quit while paused and resume later with the resume command
  - Updated Header, ProgressDashboard, and RunApp components to display pausing/paused states
  - Added '◎' indicator for 'pausing' status, '⏸' for 'paused' status
- Files changed:
  - src/engine/types.ts (updated) - Added 'pausing' to EngineStatus type with documentation
  - src/engine/index.ts (updated) - Enhanced runLoop with pause check and wait loop, updated pause()/resume() methods, added isPaused()/isPausing() helpers
  - src/tui/theme.ts (updated) - Added 'pausing' to RalphStatus type, added pausing indicator
  - src/tui/components/Header.tsx (updated) - Added 'pausing' case to getStatusDisplay()
  - src/tui/components/ProgressDashboard.tsx (updated) - Added 'pausing' case with "Pausing after current iteration..." label
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Enhanced keyboard handler for pause toggle, added pausing status mapping
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - Added pause/resume event handlers for state persistence
  - src/commands/resume.tsx (updated) - Enhanced to handle paused state persistence and proper cleanup
- **Learnings:**
  - Two-stage pause (pausing → paused) provides better UX than immediate pause during long operations
  - The engine loop checks pause state at the top of each iteration, not in the middle
  - Pressing 'p' twice quickly cancels a pending pause - useful if user changes their mind
  - Session persistence uses isPaused flag and pausedAt timestamp for resumable state
  - Events (engine:paused, engine:resumed) drive both TUI updates and state persistence

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.18
- What was implemented:
  - US-018: Graceful Interruption with full acceptance criteria
  - New interruption module (src/interruption/) with types, handler, and index exports
  - InterruptHandler with double-press detection (1 second window)
  - ConfirmationDialog TUI component for interrupt confirmation overlay
  - RunApp integration: showInterruptDialog prop, onInterruptConfirm/Cancel callbacks
  - RunAppWrapper component manages dialog state and bridges to interrupt handler
  - Press Ctrl+C shows confirmation: "Interrupt Ralph? [y/N]"
  - Press y to confirm: stops agent, saves state, exits gracefully with code 0
  - Press n or Esc to cancel and continue execution
  - Press Ctrl+C twice quickly to force quit immediately (exit code 1)
  - In headless mode: first Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown with hint about double-press
  - Session state properly saved before exit (status: 'interrupted')
  - Agent process properly terminated via engine.dispose()
  - SIGTERM handled separately (always graceful, no confirmation)
- Files changed:
  - src/interruption/types.ts (new) - InterruptState, InterruptHandler, ConfirmationDialogProps types

  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Added interrupt dialog props and keyboard handling
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - RunAppWrapper, interrupt handler integration, headless mode updates
- **Learnings:**
  - OpenTUI uses `border: true` with `borderColor` instead of CSS-style `borderStyle`
  - OpenTUI text elements use `fg` prop directly, not style objects with textAlign
  - Modal centering requires nested flex containers, no CSS transforms support
  - React state for dialogs requires wrapper component when logic is in non-React code
  - Signal handlers must be properly cleaned up via dispose() to prevent memory leaks
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.20
- What was implemented:
  - US-020: Iteration Output Persistence with full acceptance criteria
  - New logs module (src/logs/) with types, persistence, and index exports
  - Iteration logs now saved to .ralph-tui/iterations/ directory (new standard location)
  - Log format: iteration-{N}-{taskId}.log with structured header + raw output

- **Learnings:**
  - Structured log format with dividers allows machine-parseable headers while preserving raw output
  - Separating stdout/stderr in logs helps debugging agent issues vs task issues
  - The old .ralph-output/ directory used minimal markdown; new format is richer with full metadata
  - Log cleanup should sort by iteration number descending to keep most recent
  - Partial task ID matching in filter enables fuzzy search (e.g., "US-" matches all user stories)

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.21
- What was implemented:
  - US-021: Single Instance Lock with full acceptance criteria
  - New lock.ts module with dedicated lock management functionality
  - Lock file (.ralph-session/ralph.lock) contains: PID, start time, session ID, hostname
  - checkLock(): Check for existing lock and determine if stale (PID not running)
  - acquireLockWithPrompt(): Main entry point with proper error messages and interactive prompts
  - Error message matches spec: "Ralph already running in this repo (PID: X)"
  - Interactive prompt for stale lock cleanup: "Remove the stale lock and continue? [Y/n]"
  - Non-interactive mode (--headless) auto-cleans stale locks with warning
  - registerLockCleanupHandlers(): Register exit/SIGTERM/exception handlers for crash recovery
  - Lock released on clean exit and all error paths
  - --force flag still works to override active locks
- Files changed:
  - src/session/lock.ts (new) - Dedicated lock management module
  - src/session/index.ts (updated) - Export new lock functions
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - Use acquireLockWithPrompt, register cleanup handlers
- **Learnings:**
  - Separating lock logic into its own module keeps concerns clean
  - Interactive vs non-interactive mode (headless) needs different stale lock handling
  - process.kill(pid, 0) is the standard way to check if a process is running
  - Cleanup handlers should be registered and unregistered properly to prevent memory leaks
  - The session module already had good primitives; this just adds user-facing integration

  - User stories can be generated heuristically from answers - real AI generation would be better
  - The prd.json format from json.ts tracker defines the target structure for conversion
  - Follow-up questions when answers are too brief improve PRD quality
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.25
- What was implemented:
  - US-025: PRD to JSON Conversion with full acceptance criteria

  - Section extraction requires careful boundary detection (next header or separator)
  - Order-based priority (1st story = P1) provides sensible defaults when not explicit
  - Reusing prompts.ts from setup module maintains consistent terminal UI
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.26
- What was implemented:
  - US-026: PRD to Beads Conversion with full acceptance criteria
  - Extended ConvertFormat type to support 'beads' in addition to 'json'
  - Added --labels, -l option for custom labels (ralph always included)
  - execBd() helper function for spawning bd commands with stdout/stderr capture
  - convertToBeads() function that orchestrates the entire conversion:
    1. Creates epic bead with PRD name, description, labels, P1 priority
    2. Creates child beads for each user story with parent reference
    3. Sets up dependencies from explicit dependsOn fields in stories
    4. Runs bd sync after creation
  - executeBeadsConversion() handles bd availability check and summary display
  - Story beads include acceptance criteria as markdown checklist in description
  - All created bead IDs displayed at end for easy reference
  - Run command hint: ralph-tui run --epic <epicId>
- Files changed:
  - src/commands/convert.ts (updated) - Added beads format support, ~300 new lines
- **Learnings:**
  - bd create --silent returns just the new bead ID on stdout (perfect for scripting)
  - bd dep add <blocked-id> <blocker-id> creates blocking dependency
  - The epic/child pattern via --parent flag creates hierarchical beads
  - Labels are always comma-separated for both CLI args and internal arrays
  - Sync failures shouldn't abort the whole conversion (beads are already created)
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.28
- What was implemented:
  - US-028: Status Command (Headless) with full acceptance criteria
  - Enhanced `ralph-tui status` command for CI/scripts use
  - Added --json flag for machine-readable JSON output
  - Status types: running, paused, completed, failed, no-session
  - Task progress: X/Y completed with percentage
  - Iteration progress: current/max iterations
  - Elapsed time in seconds (JSON) and human-readable format (text)
  - Active tracker and agent plugin names displayed
  - Exit codes for CI: 0 (completed), 1 (running/paused), 2 (failed/no-session)
  - Lock check to determine running status (process actually running vs stale lock)
  - StatusJsonOutput type with full session/lock details
  - Updated CLI help with Status Options section and examples
- Files changed:
  - src/commands/status.ts (rewritten) - Full implementation with JSON output and exit codes
  - src/cli.tsx (updated) - Added Status Options and --json example
- **Learnings:**
  - CI tools need both JSON output AND proper exit codes for pipeline integration
  - Lock check + session file status together determine actual running state
  - Separating data gathering from display logic enables both human and machine outputs
  - Exit codes should be semantic: 0=success, 1=in-progress, 2=error/no-session
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.29
- What was implemented:
  - US-029: Log Output Mode with full acceptance criteria
  - Added --no-tui flag as alias for --headless
  - Created StructuredLogger class for CI/scripts output
  - Log format: [timestamp] [level] [component] message
  - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
  - Log components: progress, agent, engine, tracker, session, system
  - Progress updates: [INFO] [progress] Iteration X/Y: Working on task-id - task title
  - Agent output streamed with [AGENT] prefix (info for stdout, warn for stderr)
  - All same flags work as TUI mode
  - Iteration output still saved to files via existing saveIterationLog()
- Files changed:
  - src/logs/structured-logger.ts (new) - Structured logger class and factory
  - src/logs/index.ts (updated) - Export structured logger
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - Added --no-tui flag, rewrote runHeadless to use structured logger
  - src/cli.tsx (updated) - Updated help text with --no-tui flag
- **Learnings:**
  - Structured logging separates concerns: formatting vs output stream vs level filtering
  - The factory pattern (createStructuredLogger) provides sensible defaults while allowing customization
  - Using stderr for WARN and ERROR levels follows Unix convention and allows piping stdout
  - The engine already emits all necessary events (agent:output, iteration:*, etc.) - just needed to format them
---

  - src/tui/components/index.ts (updated) - Export HelpOverlay
- **Learnings:**
  - Browser opening is platform-dependent: xdg-open (Linux), open (macOS), start (Windows)
  - Keyboard shortcuts should be categorized for better discoverability in help
  - The useCallback dependency array must include state used in early returns (showHelp)
  - Overlay components with absolute positioning work well for modal dialogs in OpenTUI
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.35
- What was implemented:
  - BUG: Fixed incorrect docs URL pointing to anthropics/ralph-tui
  - Replaced hardcoded URLs with dynamic detection from git remote origin
  - Added getRepoUrl() function that detects SSH and HTTPS git remote URLs
  - Converts SSH URLs (git@github.com:user/repo.git) to HTTPS format
  - Caches detected URL to avoid repeated git calls in same session
  - Falls back to subsy/ralph-tui when not in a git repo
  - Refactored DOC_PATHS to store relative paths, base URL composed at runtime
- Files changed:
  - src/commands/docs.ts (updated) - Dynamic repo URL detection
- **Learnings:**
  - Git remote URLs come in two formats: SSH (git@github.com:user/repo) and HTTPS
  - Regex patterns need (?:\.git)?$ to handle optional .git suffix
  - Caching expensive operations (git remote calls) improves CLI responsiveness
  - Separating base URL from section paths enables flexible URL composition
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.37
- What was implemented:
  - BUG: TUI should show in_progress tasks
  - Added 'tasks' array to EngineStartedEvent in engine/types.ts
  - Engine now fetches and emits initial tasks in 'engine:started' event
  - RunApp now initializes task list from engine:started event
  - Added trackerStatusToTaskStatus() to map tracker status to TUI status
  - Added trackerTaskToTaskItem() helper for TrackerTask → TaskItem conversion
- Files changed:
  - src/engine/types.ts (updated) - Added tasks array to EngineStartedEvent
  - src/engine/index.ts (updated) - Fetch and emit tasks in start()
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Handle initial tasks, status mapping
- **Learnings:**
  - Event-driven UIs need initial state via events, not just reactive updates
  - Domain model boundaries: TrackerTaskStatus vs TUI TaskStatus require mapping
  - The engine already fetched both open/in_progress tasks but didn't expose them to the TUI
  - Keeping the event-driven pattern (vs props) maintains architectural consistency
---

## 2026-01-11 - ralph-tui-45r.36
- What was implemented:
  - BUG: TUI should not close automatically - only by user command
  - The TUI was closing when engine stopped (all tasks done, no tasks, max iterations, error)
  - Modified runWithTui to use a Promise that only resolves when user explicitly quits
  - Added 'complete' and 'idle' to RalphStatus type for clearer status display
  - Updated Header and ProgressDashboard to show descriptive stop reasons
  - RunApp now uses event-driven status updates instead of engine.getStatus()
  - Status mapping: completed → "Complete", no_tasks → "No More Tasks", etc.
- Files changed:
  - src/commands/run.tsx (updated) - Added quit promise pattern to keep TUI alive
  - src/tui/theme.ts (updated) - Added 'complete' and 'idle' status types and indicators
  - src/tui/components/Header.tsx (updated) - Added complete/idle status display
  - src/tui/components/ProgressDashboard.tsx (updated) - Added complete/idle status display
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Event-driven status, removed unused code
- **Learnings:**
  - The engine.start() promise resolving shouldn't mean "exit TUI" - decouple lifecycle
  - Use a separate quit promise pattern to wait for explicit user action
  - Event-driven status (via useState) is more reliable than calling engine.getStatus()
  - Distinguishing stop reasons (complete vs idle vs stopped) improves user experience
---

  - Updated keyboard shortcuts in footer and help overlay
  - Added useEffect to clamp selectedIndex when filter changes
  - useMemo for displayedTasks to enable filtered navigation
- Files changed:
  - src/tui/theme.ts (updated) - Added 'closed' to TaskStatus, colors.task.closed, statusIndicators
  - src/tui/components/LeftPanel.tsx (updated) - Greyed-out styling for closed tasks

  - src/engine/index.ts (updated) - Fetch completed tasks in start()
  - src/tui/components/RunApp.tsx (updated) - Status mapping, 'h' key toggle, displayedTasks filter
- **Learnings:**
  - Distinguish 'done' (current session completion) from 'closed' (historical completion) for UX clarity
  - useMemo for filtered lists enables keyboard handlers to access correct length
  - useEffect to clamp selectedIndex prevents out-of-bounds when filter shrinks list
  - TaskStatus type extension requires updating colors.task and statusIndicators in theme.ts
